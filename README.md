Mostly used when terraforming an EC2 instance for development.

I lean heavily on [Braintree's vim config](https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles) so this contains only my local overrides

## Installation

1. Clone into ~/.dotfiles
1. Use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm#installation) to install into your local directory

```
git clone https://github.com/maorleger/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cp ~/.dotfiles/rcrc ~/.rcrc # rcm configuration file needs to be copied first
rcup
```

## Uninstall

```
rcdn
```
